                                In this episode of the Data Engineering Podcast, host Tobias Macey welcomes back Nick Schrock, CTO and founder of Dagster Labs, to discuss Compass - a Slack-native, agentic analytics system designed to keep data teams connected with business stakeholders. Nick shares his journey from initial skepticism to embracing agentic AI as model and application advancements made it practical for governed workflows, and explores how Compass redefines the relationship between data teams and stakeholders by shifting analysts into steward roles, capturing and governing context, and integrating with Slack where collaboration already happens. The conversation covers organizational observability through Compass's conversational system of record, cost control strategies, and the implications of agentic collaboration on Conway's Law, as well as what's next for Compass and Nick's optimistic views on AI-accelerated software engineering.<br/>

                                        Data teams everywhere face the same problem: they're forcing ML models, streaming data, and real-time processing through orchestration tools built for simple ETL. The result? Inflexible infrastructure that can't adapt to different workloads. That's why Cash App and Cisco rely on Prefect. Cash App's fraud detection team got what they needed - flexible compute options, isolated environments for custom packages, and seamless data exchange between workflows. Each model runs on the right infrastructure, whether that's high-memory machines or distributed compute. Orchestration is the foundation that determines whether your data team ships or struggles. ETL, ML model training, AI Engineering, Streaming - Prefect runs it all from ingestion to activation in one platform. Whoop and 1Password also trust Prefect for their data operations. If these industry leaders use Prefect for critical workflows, see what it can do for you at <a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/prefect" target="_blank">dataengineeringpodcast.com/prefect</a>

                                        Data migrations are brutal. They drag on for months—sometimes years—burning through resources and crushing team morale. Datafold's AI-powered Migration Agent changes all that. Their unique combination of AI code translation and automated data validation has helped companies complete migrations up to 10 times faster than manual approaches. And they're so confident in their solution, they'll actually guarantee your timeline in writing. Ready to turn your year-long migration into weeks?

So, for example, if the business stakeholder is presented within Slack with a data visualization that looks wrong, like the demo that we give is, like, some sales rep has a 90% win rate, and that never happens. So the demo is, like, you look into it, you do some investigation, you figure out that the sales rep is actually a customer success manager, and then that automatically submits that context back to the contact store and says, like, hey. Don &#x27;t count CSMs</a>

So and then that, it &#x27;s then checked into the context store. Knowledge is captured, and then the data team can kind of take that and manage it very explicitly. And that &#x27;s a very powerful model to boot strap. You know, generally, alternative and more heavyweight systems like semantic layers is to do this upfront</a>
                                <span>&nbsp;</span>
                                <a id="utterance221" data-u="true" data-t="1201.3151" class="transcriptUtterance" onclick="moveAudio('1201.3151')" style="color:#000000">process that is very burdensome and complicated, and you need to send the business stakeholder to a custom tool or a web app or something. And they never do that. So the knowledge stays captured in their head, which does no good to anyone except for them, maybe. But as we demonstrated, humans have limited context windows too. And what &#x27;s good for the goose is good for the gander here. So it &#x27;s important to get that out of your head and into a place where the the agents can take advantage of it. And it &#x27;s really this lightweight interface within Slack that &#x27;s really the magic on in in that part of the process.</a>

But as a result of this experience, I was like, make a data request ticket so that we have this information first class in the data warehouse. And what the system does is it scoops up that entire conversation. And think about all the context you have. You have you have who asked for it. You have all this SQL that was generated that is navigating the warehouse and trying to figure out where where things are going on. You have follow-up questions. You might have a conversation. Maybe our analyst jumps in and says, like, oh, yeah. We don &#x27;t have that because of this historical reason. It scoops all that up, synthesizes it, and creates a data request. Right?
